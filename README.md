# Game Concept
Our game is about spreading awareness about homelessness and the struggle within society.
We do this by allowing the player to make life choices that can affect the outcome of the game. The
goal of the game is to help players understand which choices can lead to a stable, financially secure
life. The player will use the keyboard to move around. They can interact with objects to gain currency,
choose options for routes to survive, and interact with NPCs. The playerâ€™s motivation for our game is to
escape homelessness and achieve a better life. The player starts in a rough area of Brooklyn and
works their way up to a better location. As the location gets better there will be better opportunities for
the player. The player is constrained by having to make difficult life choices and manage resources
such as money and hunger.
